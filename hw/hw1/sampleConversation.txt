0A: Pete: 
        My name is Pigeonhole Pete, your friendly neighborhood mathematician.
        I was programmed by Zachary McNulty to solve the world's most difficult problems,
        but instead I find myself talking to you. When you inevitably bore me, contact
        zmcnulty@uw.edu so you can bother someone else.
        What do you want now?

        

0B: Shrek: I am Shrek the ogre.
        Kuo Hong made me.
        If you got a problem, go bother him at kuo22@uw.edu.
